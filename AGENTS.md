# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Code Agents when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`agent_daemon` is a packaged Ruby gem: a daemon that orchestrates CLI AI agents (Claude Code, OpenCode). It runs one thread per configured runner, each with a trigger (Yandex Tracker query, file polling, or Mattermost @-mentions), a backend, and a prompt template, plus one Messenger thread that delivers webhook notifications. **The core daemon is stdlib only.** Two narrow exceptions carry runtime gems, and both are confined to the subsystem that needs them:

- `eventmachine` + `faye-websocket` — used *only* by the `mattermost` trigger, to handle the WebSocket protocol instead of hand-rolling RFC 6455.
- `puma` + `rack` + `oauth2` — used *only* by the supervisor's web console (`lib/agent_daemon/supervisor/console/`), authorized by NFR6/AD-6. `test/test_require_isolation.rb` is the guard: `require "agent_daemon"` must load none of them, and that is enforced, not aspirational.

Everything else stays stdlib. Do not add any other gems to the runtime path, and do not reach for these from outside the subsystem that owns them; `minitest`/`rake` are dev-only.

## Commands

```bash
bundle install
rake test                                   # full suite
ruby -Ilib -Itest test/test_config_defaults.rb   # single test file
bin/agent-daemon config.yml                 # run the daemon against a config
gem build agent_daemon.gemspec              # build the gem
```

There is no linter configured. Tests are Minitest (`test/test_*.rb`), no spec DSL.

## Architecture

Read `docs/architecture.md` first — it is the authoritative design reference. Key points that span multiple files:

- **Threads communicate only through the filesystem.** Runners write YAML files into `message_dir`; the Messenger polls that same directory and POSTs them to the webhook. There is no in-process queue or shared mutable state between runners.
- **`ShutdownFlag` (`daemon.rb`) is an intentionally mutex-free boolean.** It relies on MRI's GIL for atomic read/write. Every long loop (runner iteration, backend select-loop, `wait_interval`) polls it ~every 1s (0.5s in the backend) so shutdown is cooperative. Don't add locking around it or introduce blocking sleeps that ignore it.
- **Runner inheritance:** `Runner::Base` owns the poll → process → attempt-tracking loop. Subclasses (`Runner::Tracker`, `Runner::File`) implement only `fetch_work_items`, `work_item_key`, `render_prompt`, plus optional `after_success/after_failure/after_killed/after_exhausted` hooks. `Runner::Mattermost < Runner::File` reuses the file-poll machinery wholesale and only overrides `render_prompt` to expose the listener's work-item fields as `{{...}}` vars. `Runner::Pachca` and `Runner::GitHub` are ordinary pollers like `Runner::Tracker`. Add new trigger types here and wire them in `Daemon#runner_factory_for`. `before_attempt` is the one hook that fires *before* the backend — for telling a source it was heard, since a run takes minutes.
- **Mattermost trigger (push, not poll for delivery).** A `mattermost` runner is split in two: a `Mattermost::Listener` receives @-mentions over a WebSocket and writes `<post_id>.yml` work-items into an inbox, and the `Runner::Mattermost` file-poll consumer picks them up. The listeners do **not** own threads — they run inside a single shared `Mattermost::Reactor` (`Daemon#reactor_factory_for`), registered as the `:mattermost_reactor` thread, a peer to the Messenger. There is exactly one reactor for all mattermost runners because EventMachine's reactor is a process singleton; it is restarted by `monitor_threads` like any other thread. The listener resolves its bot id (`GET /api/v4/users/me`) and team id (`GET /api/v4/teams/name/{team}`) *before* `EM.run` so the reactor thread never blocks on IO, then filters `posted` events (not-self + event `team_id` matches the configured team + allowlisted channel + bot mentioned), de-dups by post id across inbox/done/failed, and reconnects with capped backoff (1s→30s, reset on the server `hello`). The agent replies by writing a message YAML carrying `channel_id` + `root_id` (see Config + the Messenger section in `docs/architecture.md`).
- **Pachca trigger (poll, and deliberately so).** Pachca has no realtime API — outgoing webhooks and an event history endpoint are the only two ways in — and the history needs no public URL, so `Runner::Pachca` is one class with no listener, no reactor and no new dependency. `GET /webhooks/events` + `DELETE` make it a queue with an explicit ack: `after_success` deletes, and so does an event the runner decided *not* to act on. That last part is load-bearing — every answer comes back as an event authored by the bot, and if nothing cleared those the history would fill until real questions fall off the first page. Consequently **one bot token belongs to exactly one runner**. `trigger.bot_user_id` is required for the same family of reasons: the agent replies into the chat it reads.
- **Backend factory:** `Backend.for(...)` dispatches on the `backend` config key (`claude`, `opencode`, `codex`). `FALLBACK_AGENT=1` swaps in the runner's `fallback_agent` — which is either another backend's name or a `{command, args}` Hash — and applies to every backend, since whichever agent a runner uses is the one whose quota can run out. `Backend::Codex` fixes `--sandbox workspace-write` on purpose: the agent's only output is a file it writes, so read-only would mean runs that "succeed" having written nothing, and acknowledging triggers would discard the work. Backends run the CLI via `Open3.popen3` with `pgroup: true` and return a `Result` with `reason` ∈ `:ok | :failed | :timeout | :killed`. On timeout/shutdown the whole process group gets `SIGTERM` then `SIGKILL` after 2s.
- **Two independent failure counters:** per-item attempts (`max_attempts`, default 3 → `after_exhausted`) vs. consecutive *trigger* errors (`MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS` = 3 → writes a `SYSTEM:<runner>` error YAML to `message_dir` for the Messenger to notify). `:killed` results roll the attempt counter back (shutdown is not a failure).
- **Crash recovery:** `Daemon#monitor_threads` restarts any thread that died with `Thread.current[:crashed]` after `RESTART_DELAY` (60s).
- **Supervisor restart control:** The authenticated console never manipulates threads directly. CSRF-protected `POST /restart` — id and confirmation read from the form body only, CSRF token from the body or an `X-CSRF-Token` header — calls the master-owned `RestartControl`, which queues an actor-labelled intent on `RunnerSupervisor`; each generation gets a fresh `CancelToken` observed separately from the process-wide `ShutdownFlag`. Restart activity remains in-memory until Epic 5.

## Config (`config.rb`)

Loaded from a YAML path (CLI arg to `bin/agent-daemon`). Config is validated eagerly in the constructor and raises `ConfigError` with all problems collected — preserve this fail-fast behavior. Note the path-resolution rules, which are easy to get wrong:

- `message_dir`, `output_dir`, and file-trigger `input_dir/archive_dir/failed_dir` resolve relative to **`project_path`**. The `mattermost` trigger shares the same three work dirs (via `resolve_trigger_dirs`) and, when they are omitted, defaults them to `mentions/<runner-name>/{inbox,done,failed}` under `project_path`.
- `prompt_template` resolves relative to the **config file's directory**, and the resolved value is stored as `prompt_template_path` (this is the key the runner reads, not `prompt_template`).
- Defaults live in `DEFAULTS` / `RUNNER_DEFAULTS` / trigger default constants; new config keys should get a default there and validation in `validate!`.

The config file is rendered through ERB before YAML parsing (`read → ERB.result(binding) → safe_load`), so secrets can come from the environment via `<%= secret('KEY') %>` (fail-fast + `.to_json` YAML-safe quoting) or raw `<%= ENV['KEY'] %>` (lenient). Render-time failures are wrapped as `ConfigError`. The daemon stays sops-agnostic — operators populate `ENV` themselves (e.g. `sops exec-env secrets.enc.yml -- bin/agent-daemon config.yml`). See `docs/secrets.md`.

`examples/config.yml` is a fully commented reference.

## Prompt templates

`{{variable}}` substitution. Variables come from: every key in the runner config hash, plus `message_dir`, optional `output_dir`, and trigger-runtime vars (`task_key` for tracker, `input_file` for file/mattermost). The mattermost consumer additionally exposes the work-item fields the listener captured: `message`, `channel_id`, `root_id`, `sender`, `channel_name`, `post_id` — so a mention prompt can quote the message and reply into the originating thread by writing a YAML with `channel_id`/`root_id`. Undefined `{{...}}` stay literal and log a warning — intentional, don't make them raise.

## Conventions

- All files use `# frozen_string_literal: true`.
- This is a published gem — bump `lib/agent_daemon/version.rb` and update `CHANGELOG.md` for releases.
