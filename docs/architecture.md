# Architecture

## Overview

AgentDaemon is a Ruby daemon that runs one thread per configured runner plus a
dedicated Messenger thread. Threads communicate exclusively through the
filesystem (YAML files in a shared directory). The core daemon is stdlib-only
except for `eventmachine` and `faye-websocket`, confined to the `mattermost`
trigger's WebSocket client. The optional supervisor web console separately owns
`puma`, `rack`, and `oauth2`; those dependencies are not loaded by
`require "agent_daemon"` or used outside `lib/agent_daemon/supervisor/console/`.

## Threading Model

`Daemon` starts one `Thread` per runner entry in the config, plus one for
`Messenger`. When at least one `mattermost` runner exists it also starts a single
shared `Mattermost::Reactor` thread (`:mattermost_reactor`) — one for *all*
mattermost runners, because EventMachine's reactor is a process singleton (see
[Runner::Mattermost](#runnermattermost)). All threads share a single
`ShutdownFlag` instance — a lightweight object whose `@value` boolean flips from
`false` to `true` on shutdown. Because MRI's GIL makes boolean reads/writes
atomic, no mutex is needed.

The `Daemon#monitor_threads` loop checks every second whether any thread has
crashed (marked via `Thread.current[:crashed]`). A crashed thread is restarted
after a 60-second delay (`RESTART_DELAY`).

On `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`, the flag is set. Each thread's main loop checks the
flag on every iteration and exits cleanly. `Daemon` then joins all threads with
a 30-second timeout per thread.

## Runners

### Runner::Base

The abstract base class that owns the shared loop: poll for work items, process
each one through a Backend, track per-item attempt counts, and escalate on
consecutive trigger failures.

Key extension points (subclasses must implement):

| Method             | Purpose                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `fetch_work_items` | Return an array of work items          |
| `work_item_key`    | Unique string key for attempt tracking |
| `render_prompt`    | Build the prompt string for the agent  |

Optional hooks: `after_success`, `after_failure`, `after_killed`,
`after_exhausted`.

### Runner::Tracker

Polls Yandex Tracker via `POST /v2/issues/_search` with a raw JQL `query`
string. Each returned issue becomes a work item keyed by its issue key.

### Runner::File

Polls `input_dir` for `*.yml` files. On success the file moves to
`archive_dir`; after exhausting `max_attempts` it moves to `failed_dir`.

Three of the four triggers are pollers; `mattermost` is the only push one, and
it costs a WebSocket client, a shared reactor thread and two gems to be so. A
trigger is only worth building as a listener when the service has a realtime
API and the latency actually matters.

### Runner::Mattermost

A `mattermost` runner turns Mattermost @-mentions — and, when configured,
direct messages from allowlisted users — into agent runs and posts the answer
back as a threaded reply. It is the only **push**-driven trigger, so it is split
across two cooperating pieces plus the shared reactor:

- **`Mattermost::Listener`** — a per-runner WebSocket handler. It does *not* own
  a thread: the reactor creates its faye-websocket client and drives the
  callbacks. Before the reactor loop starts, `#prepare` resolves the bot id once
  with a blocking `GET /api/v4/users/me` and the team id with
  `GET /api/v4/teams/name/{team}` (so the reactor thread never blocks on IO
  inside the loop). It then connects, sends an `authentication_challenge`,
  and for each incoming `posted` event rejects posts from the bot, then selects
  one route. A direct-message (`channel_type: "D"`) is accepted only when its
  `sender_name` is in the optional `direct_users` allowlist; it needs neither a
  mention nor a configured team or channel. Every other channel type retains
  the existing filters: the event's `team_id` matches the configured team (so a
  like-named channel in another team cannot trigger), its name is in the
  runner's `channels` allowlist, and its `mentions` include the bot id. The
  listener then de-duplicates by post id (checked across
  the inbox, done, and failed dirs). A qualifying post is written as a
  `<post_id>.yml` work-item into the inbox, carrying `message`, `channel_id`,
  `root_id` (the post's thread root, falling back to its own id for a top-level
  post), `sender`, `channel_name`, `post_id`, and `created_at`. On socket close
  it reconnects with capped exponential backoff (1s → 30s); the backoff resets
  only on the server's `hello` event (auth confirmed), so a bad token — which
  still opens the socket — keeps backing off instead of hot-looping.

- **`Mattermost::Reactor`** — the single shared EventMachine reactor thread that
  hosts *every* listener. EventMachine's reactor is a process singleton
  (`EM.run` runs once per process), so the daemon registers exactly one reactor
  (`:mattermost_reactor`), a peer to the Messenger, regardless of how many
  mattermost runners are configured. It resolves every listener's bot id up
  front; a listener that fails to prepare is logged and skipped without blocking
  the others. Inside `EM.run` each prepared listener opens its connection and a
  1-second periodic timer bridges the cooperative `ShutdownFlag` into `EM.stop`.
  The thread holds no un-recreatable state, so `monitor_threads` can restart it
  exactly like the runner/Messenger threads — it re-enters `EM.run` fresh and
  all clients reconnect.

- **`Runner::Mattermost < Runner::File`** — the consumer. It reuses the
  file-trigger machinery wholesale (oldest-first poll of the inbox, per-item
  attempt tracking, archive on success, move to failed on exhausted) and only
  overrides `render_prompt` to expose the work-item fields (`message`,
  `channel_id`, `root_id`, `sender`, `channel_name`, `post_id`) as `{{...}}`
  prompt variables alongside `input_file`.

The reply path is the ordinary Messenger contract: the prompt instructs the
agent to write a message YAML into `message_dir` with `channel_id` and `root_id`
copied from the work-item, which the `mattermost` transport posts verbatim into
the originating thread (see [Transports](#transports)).

### Runner::Pachca

Turns questions asked of a Pachca bot into agent runs. A plain poller — the
same shape as `Runner::Tracker`, not the listener/reactor split Mattermost
needs — because Pachca offers exactly two ways to receive events, outgoing
webhooks and an event history endpoint, and **no realtime API**. The history
needs no public URL at all: enabling "save event history" on the bot works
with an empty Webhook URL, so the daemon stays a purely outbound client and
the core acquires no HTTP server and no new dependency.

`GET /webhooks/events` plus `DELETE /webhooks/events/{id}` make the history a
queue with an explicit ack, which lands on `Runner::Base`'s existing hooks
without a new abstraction:

| Hook               | Pachca                     | `Runner::File` equivalent |
|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `fetch_work_items` | read the history           | glob `input_dir`          |
| `after_success`    | delete the event           | move to `archive_dir`     |
| `after_failure`    | nothing; the next poll retries | leave it in `input_dir` |
| `after_exhausted`  | delete, with a log line    | move to `failed_dir`      |

Three invariants are worth stating, because each fixes a failure that is hard
to read from the symptom:

- **`trigger.bot_user_id` is required.** The agent replies into the chat it
  reads, so without its own id it re-ingests its own answers as new questions
  and loops on itself.
- **An event the runner decides *not* to act on is deleted too.** Otherwise the
  history only grows — every answer comes back as an event authored by the bot,
  the author gate drops it, and nothing clears it, until `limit` of them push
  real questions off the first page and the runner goes deaf. This is also why
  one bot token must belong to exactly one runner; a second would find its
  events already deleted (sharing is unworkable anyway, since both would answer
  every question).
- **A page is filtered against a snapshot of the acknowledged set taken before
  pending deletes are retried.** Filtering against the live set reopens the hole
  it exists to close: a delete that succeeds on this poll empties the set, and a
  history that has not caught up would serve the event again.

`trigger.chats` is optional, unlike the Mattermost trigger's `channels`: the
history only holds what the bot received, so its chat memberships are already
the scope and a list only narrows it — and requiring one would lock out direct
messages, whose chat id cannot be known in advance. A listed chat also matches
its threads, whose own `chat_id` is the thread's, not the parent's. The
effective scope is logged in one line at startup, since with neither `chats`
nor `allowed_users` set the right to command the agent is the right to talk to
the bot.

Before each attempt the runner adds a reaction to the question
(`trigger.thinking_reaction`, default `agent-thinking`), for which Pachca
renders a live timer; it is removed on success, exhaustion or a killed run.
This is what `Runner::Base#before_attempt` exists for — the only hook that
fires *before* the backend, because a run takes minutes and a chat needs an
acknowledgement sooner than that. The indicator never fails a run: the first
failure switches it off for the process with one explanatory line, the likely
cause being that nobody created the custom reaction.

For a question asked **in a thread**, the runner also fetches the thread so far
(`trigger.context_messages`, default 50, 0 disables) and exposes it as
`{{thread_context}}` — a reply there ("а почему?") is routinely unreadable on
its own. Threads only: a question asked in a channel carries its own context,
and recent unrelated channel messages would be noise. One request returns at
most 50; a larger value is paged through the cursor, one request per 50, capped
at 500. A failed fetch warns and answers without the context rather than
failing the run.

## Backends

`Backend.for(runner_config, ...)` is a factory that returns the correct
subclass based on the `backend` key (`"claude"`, `"opencode"` or `"codex"`).
Runner logs name the effective backend command.

Exact `FALLBACK_AGENT=1` swaps in the runner's `fallback_agent` when the backend
is constructed; every other environment value, and a runner without the key,
keeps the configured backend. The switch applies to **every** backend — whichever
agent a runner normally uses is the one whose quota can run out — and is
process-wide on purpose, because it exists for the case where one account's
quota is exhausted and all runners have to move at once.

`fallback_agent` takes either form:

```yaml
fallback_agent: claude                       # another backend, by name
fallback_agent: {command: omp, args: [...]}  # an arbitrary CLI
```

The named form exists because the Hash form inherits none of the flags a backend
builds for itself. Writing `claude` as a raw command means restating `--add-dir`,
`--model`, `--agent`, `--output-format` and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` by
hand, and getting one of them wrong produces a fallback that fails exactly when
it is needed. A name that matches no backend is a config error, and the message
points at the `{command, args}` form.

### Backend::Base

Runs the agent CLI via `Open3.popen3` with `pgroup: true` (own process group).
A select-based loop drains stdout/stderr while checking the deadline and the
shutdown flag every 0.5 seconds. Returns a `Result` struct with one of four
`reason` values:

| Reason     | Meaning                                    |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `:ok`      | Process exited successfully (exit code 0)  |
| `:failed`  | Process exited with a non-zero exit code   |
| `:timeout` | Exceeded the runner's `timeout` setting    |
| `:killed`  | Daemon is shutting down; process was killed |

On timeout or shutdown, the entire process group receives `SIGTERM`, then
`SIGKILL` after a 2-second grace period.

### Backend::Claude

Builds: `cd <project_path> && claude -p <prompt> [--agent <agent>] [--model <model>] --add-dir <dirs> --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format text`

`--agent` is optional: it is added only when the runner's `agent` value is a
non-empty string. Omitting the key still yields `--agent task-analyst` (the
`RUNNER_DEFAULTS` value); writing `agent: null` suppresses the flag entirely.
`--model` is added only when the optional `claude.model` key is set — its value
is validated at config load.

### Backend::OpenCode

Builds: `cd <project_path> && opencode run <prompt> [--agent <agent>] --model <model> --dangerously-skip-permissions`

`--agent` follows the same rule as `Backend::Claude`. Requires
`opencode.model` in the runner config; unlike `claude.model` it is checked at
command-build time and raises `ArgumentError`, not at config load.

### Backend::Codex

Builds: `cd <project_path> && codex exec [--model <model>] --sandbox workspace-write [--add-dir <dirs>] --skip-git-repo-check --color never <prompt>`

`codex.model` is optional and validated at config load (like `claude.model`,
unlike `opencode.model`). `codex.extra_flags` is appended after the runner's
general `extra_flags`. The prompt goes last, as `codex exec [OPTIONS] [PROMPT]`
requires.

The sandbox choice is the one decision worth stating out loud. The agent's
entire output is a message YAML written into `message_dir`, so under the
safer-sounding `read-only` sandbox a run would finish *successfully* having
written nothing — and a trigger that acknowledges on success would then discard
the work item. A default that loses work silently is worse than one that grants
writes inside the working tree, so `workspace-write` is fixed in the class and
every directory the runner writes to (`message_dir`, `output_dir`) is named with
`--add-dir`; both routinely sit outside `project_path`.

Codex's `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` is **not** the counterpart
of Claude's `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Claude has no sandbox to disable,
so the flags only look alike: copying it across would not equalise behaviour, it
would remove a protection Claude never had. Operators who want it can pass it
through `codex.extra_flags`.

### Backend::ConfiguredAgent

An optional per-runner fallback for Claude scenarios. Its configuration is a
closed executable-plus-arguments shape:

```yaml
fallback_agent:
  command: omp
  args: [--print, --auto-approve, --model, gpt-5.3-codex]
```

Configuration loading requires a non-blank String `command`, an `args` Array
containing only Strings, and no keys other than `command` and `args`. The
backend builds `cd <project_path> && <command> <args...> <prompt>`, shell-escaping
every token independently and always placing the rendered prompt last. It
inherits timeout, output, cancellation, shutdown, and process-group handling
unchanged from `Backend::Base`; it is selection, not an automatic retry after a
Claude failure.

## Messenger

Polls `message_dir` for `*.yml` and `*.yaml` files every `messenger.interval`
seconds, processing the combined queue in lexicographic filename order. Each
file must contain at least a `message` key. The Messenger delegates delivery to
a **transport** chosen by `messenger.type`, then moves the file to a `sent/`
subdirectory on success without changing its basename or extension.

Three consecutive send failures log a critical warning but do not escalate
further (there is no meta-notification path for the notifier itself).

### Transports

`Transport.for(messenger_config)` (`transport/base.rb`) dispatches on
`messenger.type` — mirroring `Backend.for` — and returns a transport whose
`deliver(message_data)` raises on failure (the Messenger's consecutive-error
counting is unchanged). The `else` branch raises `ArgumentError` listing the
valid values. Adding a transport means a new `transport/<name>.rb` plus a
`when` clause.

- **`webhook`** (default, `transport/webhook.rb`): POSTs `{"text": "<message>"}`
  to `webhook_url`. Ignores any `channel`/`user` routing fields — a webhook is
  a single fixed destination — so the same message YAML is portable across
  transports.
- **`mattermost`** (`transport/mattermost.rb`): posts via the Loop/Mattermost
  bot REST API with one bot `token`. Resolves the bot id (`GET /users/me`),
  `team` id (`GET /teams/name/{team}`), channel ids
  (`GET /teams/{team_id}/channels/name/{name}`) and user ids /
  direct-channel ids (`GET /users/username/{name}` +
  `POST /channels/direct`), caching each resolution for the daemon's lifetime
  (ids are stable). Destination is chosen by precedence: a verbatim
  `channel_id` (skips all name resolution) → `user` (DM) → `channel` (named) →
  `default_channel`. An optional `root_id` threads the post as a reply. Posts
  via `POST /api/v4/posts` with `{channel_id, message}` (plus `root_id` when
  set). The `channel_id`/`root_id` pair is what the mattermost *trigger*
  consumer copies from a mention work-item so the agent's answer lands back in
  the originating thread. stdlib only (`Net::HTTP`, `json`, `uri`).
- **`pachca`** (`transport/pachca.rb`): posts via `POST /messages` with one bot
  token. Half the mattermost transport is a cache of name-to-id lookups; none
  of that exists here, because Pachca addresses everything by numeric id — the
  trigger already hands those ids to the agent — and a direct message needs no
  channel opened first (`entity_type: "user"` creates the conversation on first
  contact). Destination by precedence: a `thread` entity pair → a
  `reply_to_message_id` → any other `entity_id` → `user` (DM) → `chat_id` →
  `default_chat_id`. The first two exist because answering "in the thread"
  means two different calls depending on where the question was asked: a
  message posted in a channel has no thread of its own, so its thread is
  created first (`POST /messages/{id}/thread`, idempotent) and answered in. A
  prompt cannot be trusted to branch on that, so the reply YAML states all
  three fields unconditionally and the transport decides. `default_chat_id` is
  a numeric id, not a name — there is no name resolution to fall back on.
  stdlib only.

### Message routing

A message YAML may carry optional routing fields the agent fills in from the
context it already has:

- `channel_id: <id>` — post verbatim to that channel id (no name resolution).
  Combined with `root_id: <id>` it threads the reply. This is the pair the
  mattermost mention trigger surfaces, letting a replying agent answer in the
  exact channel and thread it was mentioned in.
- `channel: <name>` — post to that named channel (within the configured `team`).
- `user: <username>` — send a direct message to that user.
- none of the above — post to `messenger.default_channel`. `SYSTEM:<runner>`
  error messages always fall here, since the runner does not set routing fields.

Specifying both `channel` and `user` is an error — the `mattermost` transport
raises rather than silently picking one. The `webhook` transport ignores all of
these routing fields (a webhook is a single fixed destination).

The `pachca` transport reads its own set, all numeric:

- `entity_type` + `entity_id` — the pair the pachca trigger surfaces. With
  `entity_type: thread` the answer goes straight into that thread.
- `reply_to_message_id: <id>` — answer in the thread of that message, creating
  it if the message has none. This is what turns a question asked in a channel
  into a threaded reply.
- `user: <id>` — send a direct message.
- `chat_id: <id>` — post to that chat.
- `parent_message_id: <id>` — optional, threads the post as a reply.
- none of the above — post to `messenger.default_chat_id`, where
  `SYSTEM:<runner>` errors land.

Both `user` and `chat_id` is an error, as is `entity_type` without an
`entity_id` — the latter is most likely a reply whose id never got substituted,
and sending it to the default chat would drop the answer in the wrong place
rather than fail loudly.

## Prompt Templates

`PromptTemplate` loads a text file and substitutes `{{variable}}` placeholders
at render time. Available variables:

- **All keys** from the runner config entry (e.g. `{{signature}}`,
  `{{status_backlog}}`, `{{name}}`).
- `{{message_dir}}` — absolute path to the message directory.
- `{{output_dir}}` — if set on the runner.
- **Trigger-specific runtime vars**:
  - Tracker: `{{task_key}}` (the issue key).
  - File: `{{input_file}}` (absolute path to the YAML work item).
  - Mattermost: `{{input_file}}` plus the captured work-item fields
    `{{message}}`, `{{channel_id}}`, `{{root_id}}`, `{{sender}}`,
    `{{channel_name}}`, `{{post_id}}`.
  - Pachca: the event payload flattened — `{{message}}`, `{{sender_id}}`,
    `{{chat_id}}`, `{{message_id}}`, `{{entity_type}}`, `{{entity_id}}`,
    `{{parent_message_id}}`, `{{thread_message_id}}`, `{{thread_chat_id}}`,
    `{{event_id}}`, `{{created_at}}`, `{{url}}` — plus `{{thread_context}}`,
    the thread so far as a transcript with the agent's own lines labelled
    `bot`. There is no thread id among them: a thread's own id is `entity_id`
    when `entity_type` is `thread`, and the payload's `thread` object carries
    only the message the thread hangs off of and that message's chat.

Undefined variables remain literal and produce a log warning. A variable whose
value is nil renders empty instead — the key exists, so it is substituted.

When the agent writes a message YAML into `message_dir`, the prompt template
should teach it the contract: a required `message` key plus, for the
`mattermost` transport, optional routing fields. To reply to a mention in its
originating thread, the prompt copies `channel_id: {{channel_id}}` and
`root_id: {{root_id}}` straight from the work-item. To notify a named
destination instead, set at most one of `channel: <name>` or `user: <username>`
(both is an error). Omitting all routing fields sends to
`messenger.default_channel`.

## Error Handling and Escalation

Each runner tracks consecutive trigger failures (e.g. Tracker API errors, file
glob I/O errors). After `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS` (3) consecutive failures, the
runner writes an error YAML file to `message_dir` with
`task_key: "SYSTEM:<runner-name>"`, which the Messenger picks up and sends as a
notification. The counter then resets.

Per-item failures use a separate attempt counter. After `max_attempts` (default
3) failed backend invocations for the same work item, the item is skipped and
`after_exhausted` is called.

## Configuration

YAML-based, loaded by `AgentDaemon::Config`. See `examples/config.yml` for a
fully commented example.

For a Mattermost runner, `trigger.direct_users` is optional. When present it
must be a non-empty list of non-empty Mattermost usernames and enables incoming
one-to-one direct messages from exactly those users. The listener accepts the
Mattermost event's optional leading `@` in `sender_name`; configure usernames
without it. `channels` may be empty
only with a valid `direct_users` allowlist, which configures a direct-message-
only runner. Otherwise, `channels` remains required for non-DM posts.

A Pachca runner requires only `trigger.token` and `trigger.bot_user_id`. All of
its ids are Integers rather than names, which matters when they come from the
environment: `secret('KEY')` yields a quoted JSON string and would fail
validation, so numeric keys have to be interpolated as raw `ENV` values.
`chats`, `allowed_users`, `event_types`, `thinking_reaction` and
`context_messages` are optional and validated only when present;
`context_messages` is bounded at 500 because everything above one page of 50 is
another request made in front of an agent that has not started yet.

### Operator descriptions (`description` / `support`)

Both keys are optional and accepted at two levels: the top of a workflow config
(describing the whole flow) and inside a single `runners` entry (describing that
one piece of work). Nothing in the daemon reads them — they exist so the
supervisor console can answer "what is this and who owns it" for someone who did
not write the config. `support` is a closed vocabulary (`Config::SUPPORT_KEYS`:
`owner`, `runbook`, `on_failure`); an unknown key is a load error rather than a
silently ignored typo, and `runbook` must be an `http(s)` URL because the console
renders it as an anchor.

Runner-level keys are also prompt variables, so `{{description}}` is available in
that runner's template. Descriptions are not passed through the Redactor — they
are operator prose, not agent output, and must not contain secrets.

### Path Resolution

| Path                                          | Resolved relative to |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `message_dir`, `output_dir`                   | `project_path`       |
| `trigger.input_dir`, `archive_dir`, `failed_dir` | `project_path`   |
| `prompt_template`                             | Config file's directory |

Absolute paths are used verbatim.

A `mattermost` trigger reuses the same `input_dir`/`archive_dir`/`failed_dir`
resolution as the file trigger; when those keys are omitted they default to
`mentions/<runner-name>/inbox`, `mentions/<runner-name>/done`, and
`mentions/<runner-name>/failed` (each then resolved relative to `project_path`).

A `pachca` trigger resolves no work dirs at all: it acknowledges an event by
deleting it from Pachca's own history, so there is no inbox, done or failed
directory to place.

### Validation

Config loading fails immediately with descriptive errors when:

- `runners` is missing, not a list, or empty.
- Runner names are duplicated.
- A runner is missing `name`, `prompt_template`, or `trigger`.
- `trigger.type` is not `tracker`, `file`, `mattermost`, or `pachca`.
- Trigger-specific required keys are missing (e.g. a `mattermost` trigger
  requires `base_url`, `token`, `team`, and a non-empty `channels` list; a
  `pachca` trigger requires `token` and a positive Integer `bot_user_id`).
- `messenger.type` is not `webhook`, `mattermost`, or `pachca`, or a `pachca`
  messenger is missing `token` or a positive Integer `default_chat_id`.
- A prompt template file does not exist on disk.
- A runner's optional `fallback_agent` is not a Hash with exactly a non-blank
  String `command` and an `args` Array containing only Strings.
- A `description` is present but blank or not a String, `support` is not a Hash,
  it carries an unknown key, one of its values is blank, or `support.runbook` is
  not an `http(s)` URL — at either the config or the runner level.

## Supervisor

`bin/agent-supervisor <supervisor-config.yml>` runs **N whole workflows** (each
an ordinary, unchanged `AgentDaemon::Config`) as threads inside **one** MRI
process, instead of one `agent-daemon` process per workflow. It is a separate
subsystem layered *on top of* the core described above — the core itself does
not know it exists (see "Dependency isolation" below). The full invariant set
this subsystem is built against (AD-1…AD-16) is captured in the project's
internal architecture spine — a planning artifact kept outside this repository,
not a shipped document; this section describes the shape implemented through
Epic 4 — including the in-memory live console and authenticated restart
control. SQLite history and the metrics exporter remain assigned to Epics 5
and 6.

### Layout

One file per concern under `lib/agent_daemon/supervisor/`:

### Supervisor config

`Supervisor::Config` enumerates workflows, each `{name:, config: <path>}`,
where `config` resolves relative to the supervisor config file's own directory
(the same rule core uses for `prompt_template`) and is loaded as an ordinary
`AgentDaemon::Config` — no new config dialect. Loading fails fast, collecting
every problem into one `ConfigError` (mirroring core): missing/duplicate
workflow names, a workflow or runner name containing the `:` identity
delimiter, a referenced config that fails to load, and two workflows whose
`message_dir`/`output_dir`/trigger work-dirs collide (a shared `project_path`
alone is not a collision). See `examples/supervisor.yml`.
`restart_warning_margin_seconds` is a supervisor-level integer (default 5,
range 1..300) added to the fixed restart delay only when the read model decides
whether to display a delayed-restart warning; it does not change scheduling.

### Master: one process, many workflows

`Supervisor::Master` builds one entity factory per runner across every
workflow, plus one per-workflow Messenger (skipped if unconfigured) and
exactly **one** fleet-wide `Mattermost::Reactor` shared by every workflow's
mattermost runners — EventMachine's reactor is a process singleton, so this
mirrors the standalone daemon's one-reactor rule at fleet scale instead of
per-config. Runners are keyed by the composite `(workflow, runner)`
`RunnerIdentity` (`workflow:runner` thread key and log tag) rather than by
runner name alone, since a runner name is only unique *within* its workflow.

Each entity is wrapped in a `RunnerSupervisor` (below); `Master#start` drives
all of them through a single non-blocking ~1s tick loop
(`supervise_until_shutdown`) instead of a blocking idle sleep, so one entity's
restart delay never stalls another's supervision.
Entity factories receive `(bundle, cancel_token)`. After building the exact
supervisor roster, the master exposes an immutable console-id map only through
`RestartControl`; the console never owns or reads entity threads.

**Shutdown** is centralized: `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` set one shared `ShutdownFlag`
(same primitive as the standalone daemon), which stops the tick loop and joins
every supervised thread with a per-thread timeout (`JOIN_TIMEOUT`, 30s
default) — sequentially, so the worst case for N wedged entities is
`N * JOIN_TIMEOUT`. After the join, one final tick lets any entity that died
during the drain publish its terminal state (the tick loop otherwise never
observes a death after the flag flips). Finally, an **orphan sweep** force-kills
the in-flight agent process group of any thread still alive after its join
timeout (never `Thread#kill` — the thread itself is abandoned to process exit;
only its owned OS process group is killed).

### Per-entity supervisor: restart lifecycle, cancellation, and generation

`RunnerSupervisor` is a small state machine (`:running → :stopping →
:restarting → :running…` or terminal `:exited`) supervising a single entity's
full lifecycle — this covers all three entity kinds (runner, messenger,
reactor), not just runners. `#tick` is its only state-transition driver, called
~1/s by the master; it never sleeps, so a pending restart is a recorded
monotonic deadline, not a blocking wait. `#request_restart(actor)` is the
thread-safe ingress: callers enqueue intents from any thread, while only the
master's tick drains them and mutates lifecycle state. Concurrent requests
coalesce into one replacement generation, retaining the deduplicated actor set
and earliest millisecond request time for the structured restart event.

A crash (an uncaught exception on the entity's own thread) schedules an
automatic respawn after `RESTART_DELAY` (60s); a clean exit becomes terminal
unless a manual intent is queued. Each spawn also mints a fresh `CancelToken`.
When a live entity accepts a restart, the supervisor activates that token
before publishing `restart_requested`, then waits for cooperative exit before
the delayed respawn. Runners pass it through their backend process loop;
Messengers and the shared Mattermost reactor observe it in their own loops.
Shutdown wins every restart gate: no new turnover or replacement starts after
the shared shutdown flag is set.

Every (re)spawn increments a monotonic **generation** counter starting at 1,
and builds a fresh sink bundle and cancellation token for that generation — a
superseded (old-gen) entity's late publish still carries its own, now-stale
generation, so a downstream consumer (Epic 2's read model) can always tell
which instance a record came from.

### Publish seam (why the core needs no supervisor require)

Core components (runner, backend, messenger, reactor) report state/events only
through the narrow `AgentDaemon::Sinks` protocol defined in `sinks.rb` — a
`Bundle` of `NullState`/`NullEvent`/`NullOutput` sinks by default, so the
standalone CLI path silently discards everything it publishes (zero behavior
change, NFR5). The supervisor injects a real `Bundle` per generation
(`RunnerSupervisor#default_sinks_factory`, gen-stamped via `GenerationStamp`)
at entity-construction time; the core class being supervised is identical to
the one the standalone daemon instantiates and never names a supervisor type.
The standalone daemon keeps the no-op defaults. `Supervisor::Master` instead
injects its one `StateRegistry` and one `EventBus`, both generation-stamped,
without touching runner/backend/messenger code. Accepted registry writes
increment a mutex-protected revision; stale-generation writes do not. The bus
retains a bounded drop-oldest ring, supports backlog or tail cursors, and keeps
cursor cleanup exception-safe without producer-thread callbacks.

### Epic 2 read model and console

`Fleet` left-joins the master's immutable configured roster with current
`StateRegistry` snapshots, so an entity that has never published remains
visible as unknown. `ActivityLog` projects the newest retained records for one
entity from `EventBus`; this history is bounded, in-memory, and lost on process
restart. Neither observer reads runners, threads, or `RunnerSupervisor`.

`Fleet` also carries the config's operator descriptions: a `Fleet::Doc`
(description + `support` hash, or nil when the config says nothing) per rostered
runner, plus a workflow-name-keyed map read via `Fleet#workflow_doc`. These come
from `Master#build_factories` at boot, never from a snapshot, so they are
constant for the life of the process. The fleet page renders one clipped
description line under each name; the entity page renders the full text and the
support block, as two independent sections (the entity's own, then its
workflow's). All of it is escaped and never parsed as markdown, and the console
re-checks a runbook's scheme before emitting an `<a href>`.

The optional console is one non-clustered Puma server in the master process.
`Auth` is a default-deny Rack middleware: `/healthz` (GET/HEAD) is the only
public app route; `/auth/login` and `/auth/callback` are unauthenticated OAuth
legs handled inside the middleware, and `/auth/logout` is a CSRF-protected
POST. Every other route, including `GET /events`, requires a live server-side
session. GitLab tokens remain in private session records; HTML receives only an
immutable username/CSRF view. Group membership is rechecked fail-closed at most
once per session per 60 seconds, with concurrent streams coalesced onto one
lookup and no store mutex held during network I/O.

Authenticated **entity detail** pages expose native restart controls; the fleet
list keeps a disabled affordance on purpose, so one page never carries a form
and a CSRF token per card for an action whose diagnostics live elsewhere. The
default-deny, CSRF-protected `POST /restart` reads mutation parameters from the
form body only, derives the actor from the server-side session username, and
delegates through the master's immutable `RestartControl` id-to-supervisor map.
Unknown ids use the fixed non-disclosing 404, a missing control is 503, shutdown
refusal is 503, and acceptance redirects with 303 to the entity and
target-generation acknowledgement — which the page renders only while the read
model agrees a restart is in flight, since the target travels in the query
string and is therefore forgeable. Every accepted restart also emits one
`Log.info` line naming the actor and target generation: until Epic 5's writer
lands, that line is the only record of the action that survives the process. A
Mattermost runner restart affects only its file consumer; the fleet-wide reactor
routes through a server-rendered `GET /restart` confirmation whose POST carries
`confirmed=fleet-wide`. That step is a UI guard against an unconsidered click,
not an authorization boundary — any client already holding a valid session and
CSRF token can send the flag directly. Restarting entities disable the control,
and a restart older than `RESTART_DELAY + restart_warning_margin_seconds`
(default margin 5s, range 1..300) gains a visible warning; this is an
operational hint, not proof of failure. Restart state and activity remain
bounded and in-memory until Epic 5 adds persistence.

That recheck is driven by the live SSE stream, not by page rendering: `Auth`
publishes the revalidation callable into the Rack environment and `GET /events`
is its only caller. Page renders (`/`, `/entity`) validate the local session
only, deliberately — a GitLab round-trip on the render path would put network
latency in front of every page and would put access-control code inside `App`,
which owns none by design. Because every rendered page carries the live-update
script, a browser session loses access within one recheck interval; a client
that never opens the stream (scripting disabled, a stolen cookie replayed by a
CLI) keeps its already-issued session until `session_ttl` expires or it is
destroyed. Shortening that window is a session-TTL decision, not a rendering
one.

`GET /events` uses Rack partial hijack. Its fixed invalidations are an initial
`refresh`, one coalesced `refresh` when the registry revision, event cursor, or
cursor-loss count changes, an approximately 15-second comment heartbeat, and
`authorization_lost` before a detected revocation closes the stream. The poll
interval is 250 ms. Every terminal path closes the IO and unsubscribes the tail
cursor; server shutdown first stops these loops, then stops Puma. Each live
stream occupies one Puma request thread, so `max_threads` must stay above peak
concurrent viewers with headroom for HTML, OAuth, health, and reconnect
requests.

When the request carries an `id` naming a runner, the same connection also
multiplexes that runner's terminal output — the only payload-bearing frames in
the system. `output`, `output_run`, and `output_lagged` carry a JSON window of
`{seq, stream, text}` records plus an SSE `id:` line of
`generation:run_id:seq`; `output_state` carries `{finished, reason, truncated}`.
Output never travels the `EventBus`: the stream copy-on-read polls
`OutputBuffers#snapshot` once per existing tick, because pipeline fanout runs on
the producer thread and must never touch socket IO. Multiplexing rather than
opening a second endpoint is what keeps one viewer to one Puma thread.

The output cursor is the triple `(generation, run_id, seq)`, never `(run_id,
seq)`: each respawn builds a fresh `Backend` whose run counter restarts at 1, so
a generation change is a run change even when the run id is unchanged. A
malformed, unknown, or non-runner `id`, and any cursor half that is not a
non-negative base-10 integer, are rejected before the hijack — the id with the
fixed non-disclosing 404, the cursor by degrading to a full window.

The browser owns one `EventSource` per page. On open/reconnect and every
`refresh`, it fetches the current authenticated URL and replaces only
`<main id="console-content">`; a trailing dirty flag coalesces notifications
that arrive during a fetch. Server-rendered escaping is the HTML formatting
contract for every page render; the terminal panel is the one region the client
also builds itself, and it does so exclusively with `createElement` and
`textContent` — record text is never parsed as markup on either side. The client
seeds its window from the server-rendered lines, then appends, so a replacement
of `#console-content` repaints from the client's own cursor without losing,
duplicating, or restarting it. A successful reconnect fetch repairs gaps by re-reading
current registry state plus the retained activity ring rather than promising
durable replay; a fetch that fails leaves the previous DOM in place until the
next notification. A stream the browser closes as fatal — which is how an
expired session appears once the socket is already down, since `/events` then
answers with a redirect rather than `text/event-stream` — navigates to the login
path instead of leaving a stale page that still looks live.

### Centralized, tagged logging

The master installs one shared logger (`bin/agent-supervisor`, `Logger::DEBUG`)
for the whole fleet; each supervised entity's own thread binds ambient log
context (`Log.bind_context`) tagging every line with its `(workflow, runner)`
tag and current generation, gated by that *workflow's* configured
`logging.level` (per-tag, not global). A per-workflow `logging.file` is
ignored under the supervisor — there is one shared `$stdout` sink for the
fleet. The standalone daemon's own single-workflow logger is unchanged.

### Dependency isolation (AD-5) — the contract this story's test guards

All supervisor code lives under `AgentDaemon::Supervisor::` in files required
**only** from `bin/agent-supervisor` (directly, or transitively through
`master.rb` → `config.rb`/`runner_supervisor.rb` → `runner_identity.rb`). The
core load path — `require "agent_daemon"` and therefore `bin/agent-daemon` —
requires no supervisor file and defines no `AgentDaemon::Supervisor` constant.
`test/test_require_isolation.rb` asserts this in a clean child Ruby process
(the shared Minitest process is unsuitable: sibling test files already load
supervisor code into it before this test runs), and asserts by *feature path*
that none of `sqlite3`/`puma`/`rack`/`oauth2` are loaded. Puma, Rack and OAuth2
are installed runtime dependencies for the console but remain lazily isolated;
SQLite is still forward-guarded for Epic 5. `agent_daemon.gemspec` declares
`agent-supervisor` as a second executable alongside `agent-daemon`.

**Accepted residual:** isolation is *load-time*, not *install-time* —
`puma`/`rack`/`oauth2` are installed on every host that installs this gem, even
one that only runs the standalone `agent-daemon` CLI. The same will apply to
SQLite if Epic 5 adds it.

## Deployment

The gem includes a systemd template unit at `examples/deploy/agent-daemon@.service`.
Each department or team gets its own instance:

```
systemctl start agent-daemon@sales
systemctl start agent-daemon@support
```

The `%i` specifier maps to a config file:
`<install_dir>/configs_decrypted/%i.yml`. Configs with secrets are typically
encrypted with SOPS and decrypted at deploy time.
