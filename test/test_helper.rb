# AI-3 (Epic 1 retro): save/restore AgentDaemon::Log's global logger AND
# clear its ambient per-thread context, so a test file doesn't leak its null
# logger to whichever file happens to run after it in the same Minitest
# process. Call stub_null_logger! from #setup and restore_logger! from
# #teardown.
#
# "Restore" means restore whatever was there — which in a fresh test process
# is nil, since neither `require "agent_daemon"` nor Log.use runs at load
# time. That is the correct restoration, not a leak: it is the same state the
# file inherited. Note that Log.logger's nil fallback allocates a fresh
# Logger.new($stdout) at DEBUG per call, so a test that wants quiet output
# must stub it rather than rely on the ambient default.
